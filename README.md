# hello-world
First repository of all, to cry or laugh when I'll be able to make better code.

Here Cat Gonz√°lez, for the gracious people on Github!

I'm just starting to learn about code, so be good with me and I will give you a digital cupcake.
I'm learning in the @FreeCodeCamp website and it is great, certifies you and helps non-profits with projects as your practice.

Nice to talk, let's code!.
